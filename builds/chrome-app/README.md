# EasyRPG Player Chrome App

## Setup instructions

[Download this archive](https://ci.easyrpg.org/job/player-js/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/player-js.tar.gz) and put index.js and index.html.mem in "player".

## Standalone mode

FIXME: TODO

If you want to bundle your own game put it in the "game" folder. Don't put the root directory in it, "game" should directly contain RPG_RT.ldb, System & co.

Don't forget to edit the manifest.json and to replace the assets.
